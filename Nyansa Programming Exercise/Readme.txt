In the program, we are building an 'output' variable which is a dictionary of dictionary, where outer key is the "date" and inner dictionary is the {site:count} pair.


Time complexity of building ‘output’ dictionary: O(n)
Time complexity for printing ‘ouput’ dictionary: O(nlogn) ( for using sorted() )

Space complexity : No of dates * No. of unique sites per day

To run: 
I have added the .py file which can be run in any python environment.
Also, there is jupyter notebook file as well, which can be run in anaconda jupyter environment.
